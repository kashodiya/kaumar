        <v-card-text>
          <p>
            Welcome to Kaumar, a vibrant and inclusive community designed specifically for Indian-origin parents and their young adult children residing in the United States. Our community is rooted in the rich cultural heritage of India while embracing the diverse experiences of living in a modern, multicultural society.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">
            At Kaumar, we understand the unique challenges and joys that come with guiding children through the journey of relationships and marriage. Our mission is to create a supportive environment where members can connect, share experiences, and offer mutual support. Whether you are a parent navigating the complexities of helping your child find a life partner or a young adult seeking advice and understanding, you will find a place here that resonates with your experiences and values.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">
            Our community is built on the principles of belonging, mutual support, and cultural preservation. We believe in the power of shared experiences and the strength that comes from collective wisdom. By fostering a space where both parents and young adults can engage in meaningful conversations, we aim to bridge generational gaps and promote understanding and respect across age groups.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">
            Kaumar is not just a platform for finding life partners within the community; rather, it serves as a robust network that provides emotional, practical, and informational support. While members may form valuable connections and friendships, our primary focus is on creating a supportive ecosystem that aids in the search for life partners externally through shared resources, recommendations, and a sense of camaraderie.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">
            We are proud to be an independent community, unaffiliated with any other institutions, dedicated solely to the well-being and support of our members. Our activities range from virtual meetups and cultural celebrations to workshops with relationship experts and resource-sharing sessions. We encourage active participation, whether through joining discussions, attending events, or contributing your own experiences and insights.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">
            Join us at Kaumar and become part of a community that values your journey, understands your challenges, and celebrates your successes. Together, we can navigate the path of relationships and marriage with confidence, cultural awareness, and mutual support.
